==========

A tiny script to delete .arw files that don't have a corresponding .jpg (or
.jpeg) file in the same folder.

The script is meant to clean up a folder after deleting .jpg files of pictures
you don't want to keep. Simply run the script passing it the path to the folder
containing both .jpg and .arw files (it will ask for confirmation before
deleting anything).
